\chapter{Abstract}

The current work presents a proposal of solution to the problem of passive descent by autorotation applied to CanSat, briefly explaining how brief concepts such as CanSat and autorotation are described. Within the present, an explanation to this proposal is described contemplating, the interaction between the different systems that incorporate CanSat, as well as an estimation of resources, be these, time and money. We will talk about the creation of the universal navigation module, as well as the advantages of it. Finally, the aspects of the systems according to their applications are detailed below.
